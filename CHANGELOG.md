# CHANGELOG

## v1.0.11 (Feb 27, 2025)
- **Performance and Robustness Enhancements**
  - Reduced string allocations with format strings in logs.
  - Simplified `Initialize` by moving initial PID check to `StartInitialMonitoringAsync`.
  - Optimized `GetActiveFullscreenProcessId` to a synchronous method.
  - Optimized `UpdateLowFpsMetrics` with single-pass min/max/histogram calculation.
  - Enhanced exception logging with full stack traces.
  - Added null safety for `_cts` checks.
  - Implemented finalizer for unmanaged resource cleanup.

## v1.0.10 (Feb 27, 2025)
- **Removed 0.1% Low FPS Calculation**
  - Simplified scope by eliminating 0.1% low metric from UI and calculations.

## v1.0.9 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Fixed 1% Low Reset on Closure**
  - Ensured immediate `ResetSensorsAndQueue` before cancellation to clear all metrics.
  - Cleared histogram in `ResetSensorsAndQueue` to prevent stale percentiles.
  - Blocked post-cancel updates in `UpdateFrameTimesAndMetrics`.

## v1.0.8 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Fixed Initial Startup and Reset Delays**
  - Moved event hook setup to `Initialize` for proper timing.
  - Added immediate PID check in `Initialize` for instant startup.
  - Forced immediate sensor reset on cancellation, improving shutdown speed.

## v1.0.7 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Further Optimizations for Efficiency**
  - Added volatile `_isMonitoring` flag to prevent redundant monitoring attempts.
  - Pre-allocated histogram array in `UpdateLowFpsMetrics` to reduce GC pressure.
  - Initially moved event hook setup to field initializer (reverted in v1.0.8).

## v1.0.6 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Fixed Monitoring Restart on Focus Regain**
  - Updated event handling to restart `FpsInspector` when the same PID regains focus.
  - Adjusted debounce to ensure re-focus events are caught reliably.

## v1.0.5 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Optimized Performance and Structure**
  - Debounced event hook re-initializations to 500ms for efficiency.
  - Unified sensor resets into `ResetSensorsAndQueue`.
  - Switched to circular buffer with histogram for O(1) percentile approximations.
  - Streamlined async calls, removed unnecessary `Task.Run`.
  - Replaced `ConcurrentQueue` with circular buffer for memory efficiency.
  - Simplified threading model for updates.
  - Implemented Welfordâ€™s running variance algorithm.
  - Simplified retry logic to a single async loop.
  - Streamlined fullscreen detection logic.
  - Simplified PID validation with lightweight checks.

## v1.0.4 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Added Event Hooks and New Metrics**
  - Introduced `SetWinEventHook` for window detection.
  - Added 0.1% low FPS and variance metrics (0.1% later removed in v1.0.10).
  - Improved fullscreen detection with `DwmGetWindowAttribute`.

## v1.0.3 (Feb 24, 2025)
- **Stabilized Resets, 1% Low FPS, and Update Smoothness**
  - Added PID check in `UpdateAsync` to ensure `FpsInspector` stops on pid == 0.
  - Fixed 1% low FPS calculation sticking, updated per frame.
  - Unified updates via `FpsInspector` with 1s throttling for smoothness.

## v1.0.2 (Feb 22, 2025)
- **Improved Frame Time Update Frequency**
  - Reduced `UpdateInterval` to 200ms from 1s for more frequent updates.

## v1.0.1 (Feb 22, 2025)
- **Enhanced Stability and Consistency**
  - Aligned plugin name in constructor with header (`"InfoPanel.FPS"`) and improved description.
  - Added null check for `FpsInspector` results; resets frame time queue on PID switch.
  - Improved retry logging for exhausted attempts.

## v1.0.0 (Feb 20, 2025)
- **Initial Stable Release**
  - Core features: Detects fullscreen apps, monitors FPS in real-time, calculates frame time and 1% low FPS over 1000 frames.
  - Stability enhancements: Implements 3 retries with 1-second delays for `FpsInspector` errors, 15-second stall detection with restarts.
  - Removed early smoothing attempts due to InfoPanel UI limitations.
